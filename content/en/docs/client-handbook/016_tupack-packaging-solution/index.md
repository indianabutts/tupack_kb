In our attempt to continue to provide a quality and encompassing service to our clients, we’ve
introduced an in-house packaging solution suitable for all. The Tu Pack in-house packaging
solution includes a comprehensive list of premium, eco-friendly packaging items and all
reasonably priced. The packaging solution ranges from fully recyclable postal boxes to sturdy
wholesale boxes, as well as other general packing items such as various void fillers, brown
paper tapes, belly bands and different colours of plain tissue paper.

Our packaging solution provides multiple benefits to clients’ when utilised, as opposed to
externally sourced packaging:

**Savings on inbound and storage charges**

The use of our in-house packaging solution will remove inbound fees and storage
costs. This enables all-round efficiency, as packaging loss or mix ups are kept to a
minimum.

**Pay as you use policy**

Charges for our packaging items are made on a pay-as-you-use policy. This allows
your cost of packaging to follow in line with your real-time order volumes.

**Savings on procurement effort and lead time**

The process of sourcing the right packaging is likely to be lengthy and taxing. With
our solid and highly qualified in-house procurement team, we’re able to constantly
offer you the highest quality of packaging materials, at the most competitive prices,
and shortest lead times.

**Top-line quality guaranteed**

As with every other service we provide at Tu Pack, our in-house packaging solution
is guaranteed to stock the highest quality of packaging materials. The double peel
and seal on all our boxes and envelopes means that your customers can make
returns with ease and in a box that can accommodate multiple uses. What is even
better is that all of our packaging is recyclable and reusable.
