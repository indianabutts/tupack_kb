If you have not signed up Via Go-Cardless you must adhere to our 7-day payment terms. If you fail to settle
your account within 14 days of the invoice date, your account will be put on stop and we will suspend the
fulfilment of your incoming and existing orders. 

If payment has not been made after 30 days, Tu Pack will require a 3-month holding deposit for your account to be reinstated. This deposit will be the total value of the previous 3 months of invoices held on your account.

## Issuing of Invoices
Tu Pack will issue invoices on a weekly basis. The invoicing is completed using reports from Tu Packâ€™s
Warehouse Management System, detailing the activity for your brand that week. Additional credits will be
credited separately from your weekly invoice. We will conduct daily audits to ensure the accuracy of your
invoice.

## Credit Control
To ensure that you receive notice of any outstanding charges, we will schedule reminder emails detailing the
charges held on your account. This schedule will follow as:

**Day 2 Overdue:**

You will be sent an email outlining the amount owed and a link to view your invoice. The reminder will also
specify that you will incur a 2% late payment charge if the invoice is not settled within the next 5 days.

**Day 7 Overdue:**

On the 7th day of the overdue invoice, we will issue another reminder stating the amount of the invoice owed
on your account and that this is the last day for the account to be settled to avoid a late payment interest
charge.

**10-days Overdue:**

This email will provide a link to your invoice which will include the late payment interest charge, as per our
Terms of Service. It will also provider a reminder that your account needs to be settled within the next 4 days
to avoid being put on stop.

**12-days Overdue:**

This email will confirm that your account needs to be settled within the next 2 days to avoid being put on stop.

**14-days Overdue:**

This email will inform you that your account will be put on stop unless your outstanding balance is settled
today. This will mean we will be suspending fulfilment of your orders.

**15-days Overdue:**

Our Finance team will inform our Customer Success department of the charges on your account and instruct
them to communicate the official suspension of your account. They will then inform you that your account
has been put on stop until further notice due to failure of payment. Your account will only be rescinded once
our Finance Manager has confirmed receipt of your payment.

## Retention of Electronic Invoices
Copies of all sales and purchase invoices are retained in accordance with the legal requirements to retain
records for the previous complete six financial years plus the current financial year.
