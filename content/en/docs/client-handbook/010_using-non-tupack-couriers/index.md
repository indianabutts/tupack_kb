We acknowledge that your business may decide to ship through a courier provider that Tu Pack
does not partner with. In the event that you decide to partner with a non-Tu Pack courier and
arrange your own order collection(s), we at Tu Pack want to ensure that this process goes
smoothly and your order(s) are despatched without delay.

## The Procedure
Please make sure of the following ahead of the order collection:

- That the order details are accurate, including the shipping address, product details,
and quantity
- That the courier details are correct, including the name of the courier company, pickup location, and the date and time of collection.
- Confirm with the courier company the scheduled pick-up time and location.
- That all necessary documents and special requests needed for delivery are completed ahead of time.

On the dy of the collection, Tu Pack will be responsible for the following:
- That the order is accurately packaged, labelled and ready for despatch
- That the courier's identification and collection documents are authorised against the specific order
- Checking the deliver address on the parcel against the courier's documents
- Recording the details of the collection and the courier
