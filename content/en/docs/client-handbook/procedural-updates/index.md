We understand that things change in business all the time, whether that’s a new way of packing,
integrating an international payment system or a change in your courier preferences. 

We want tomake your changes as easy as possible, which is why we ask you to submit any changes as a
**Procedural Update** on our Success Portal.

- You'll submit a request on our Success Portal in relation to your procedural request
- One of our Success Advisers will revert to the relevant departments which the request relates
to for review, and then advise you as to whether we can accept this request
- If we can implement the change, we will send over a plan of action and communicate the
expected charges to implement the procedural update

It is also worth noting that, if your ‘Procedural Update’ requires a bit more work from our team, we
might request that you submit a Work Order. We aim to be as transparent as possible about our
costs, so we’ll let you know of any additional charges before we get started so that you can decide
whether or not to go ahead.
