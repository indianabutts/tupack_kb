This is the method of selecting your preferred couriers. Whilst the choice of your courier
should have been agreed at the beginning of your onboarding process, the actual process of
integrating it into our WMS is called mapping. This process can be done through your ecommerce platform.

If you elect to change your courier preferences after the onboarding phase, then weâ€™d be
happy to assist you with that but a procedural update fee will be applied.

Please see the video below, which illustrates the e-commerce courier mapping process.
