When items arrive at Tu Pack following the [inbound deliveries procedure](inbound-deliveries), there are three levels of stock checking available.

As standard, all inbound ASNs undergo a **Standard Visual Check**. We are able to provide a light visual exam of the items, without removing them from packaging abd confirm stock counts are in-line with the ASN and there are no obvious signs of damage.

Above that standard we are able to either randomly inspect a single item per SKU randomly, removing it from it's polybag or outer packaging to inspect for any defectsm and compile a QC report.

Finally you can request a bespoke QC service.

Both the Random and Bespoke QC require a work-order requrest to be created via the **Success Portal** with three working-days notice, and the **Work Order** number should be referenced on the ASN.
