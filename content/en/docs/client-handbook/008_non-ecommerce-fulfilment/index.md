## Wholesale Orders

Once your buyer has finalised the order, you will be issued a PO and commercial invoice
alongside packing requirements. 

It's essential that you use this PO to create a Manual Order on
our WMS. 

This must be put on at least 10 days before your buyer’s expected delivery date and
the order reference number must begin with WS and conclude with the PO number [WS-PO4567]. This is to ensure that our fulfilment team can identify the wholesale order and can assign the PO number to the cartons for the order.

Tu Pack will dispatch wholesale orders within 10 working days of them being inputted into the
WMS, unless a future despatch date is selected. Any change(s) made to existing wholesale orders will mean that Tu Pack has
an additional 5 days from the point when the change is put onto the system before they are
required to fulfil the order.

To ensure your wholesale orders are despatched correctly and on-time make sure the information is correct from the onset and require no further amendments.

At the time of input, all of the information needs to be present on the WMS:

- Products - SKUs, sizes, prices and commodity codes
- Delivery address
- Barcodes
- Packing instructions (if any)

You can follow our guide on creating wholesale orders [here](../orders/wholesale-orders).

### Changes to a Wholesale Order
It's not possible to make amendments on the WMS to an order once placed. All changes need to
be communicated to Tu Pack via the **Success Portal**. You are then required to submit a new
manual order inclusive of the amendments. Once this is on the WMS, our team will delete the
previous wholesale order.

Please be advised that, if any Ecommerce orders have been placed between the original
wholesale order and the amended version, the stock will be allocated to the Ecommerce orders
first, as they are prioritised in date order. As such, we recommend placing the replacement order
before submitting a cancellation request for the original order.

Stock is assigned to orders on a ‘first come, first served' basis. This is applicable to both stock in
the warehouse and on an ASN. Therefore, we would advise placing your wholesale order on the
system as early as possible to ensure it's a priority for stock allocation. 

You can follow our guides on [amending orders](../orders/amend-order), and creating a [wholesale order](../orders/wholesale-orders).

#### Adding to a Wholesale Order
If you would like to add additional products to your wholesale order, we are required to raise an
additional manual order. This will avoid stock reallocation to any Ecommerce orders of stock
assigned by the existing wholesale order, as well as prevent you from incurring any additional
restock or admin. charges.

For wholesale orders that don't need to be fulfilled until a later date, then please put the despatch
date in the original order and it will be despatched on this date.

## ASNs
If the wholesale orders consist of new stock that hasn’t arrived at the warehouse, it's even
more critical that the ASN is correct. You should confirm:

- The ASN is on the cartons and matches the ASN on our WMS
- The number of cartons matches the ASN allocation
- The shipment arrives on the ASN delivery date
- The SKUs are kept in the same cartons
- All items must have barcodes
- All stock must be on an ASN

We also recommend that you refer to the wholesale order number in the comments of the ASN.
This will enable our Goods-In team to book in and arrange your stock in a way that can facilitate
the speed of packing your non e-Commerce order. Additionally, it's your responsibility to keep
track of the location of your shipment and to amend the ASN accordingly.

## Bulk Orders & Stock Calls
Orders that are more than 10 items and are not being sent to your e-Commerce customers will
be referred to as **bulk orders** and will be charged a wholesale pick and pack rate. We require
that these orders are conditioned to the following rules:

- All garments will be packed in poly bags
- A manual order needs to be on our WMS no later than 3-days before the despatch date
- Order reference must begin with WS so that we can identify that this is not an e-commerce order
- Each carton will be provided with a packing list of the whole order, and a commercial invoice and waybill if international
- Each carton will not exceed 8kg
- We'll keep all the same SKUs and styles packed in the same box

Before we despatch your order, we'll inform you of the weight, dimensions and quantity of
cartons. Once the order has been packed, we'll despatch it in accordance with the date on the
Manual Order. If there is a request to delay this order from being despatched after it has been
packed, we'll have to move this order into a holding bay until it's ready to despatch. Please
advise us through our Success Portal if you’d like for us to hold the order.
