The provision of work orders is part of our commitment to develop a partnership with you and
help your brand grow. They are an integral part of our bespoke and personal service that we
offer.

In line with our communication policy, all work orders must be submitted via the Success
Portal.

Here are some top tips for submitting a work order to us:

1. Include as much information as possible, the more the better! Having the correct
information on the work order prevents the Success team from having to reach back out to
you, which means we can get started with the work requested a lot sooner. Some key
pieces of information may include:
	- SKU
    - Number of units
	- Detailed specification of work
    - Barcodes/ Labels
	- Delivery addresses
2. Use the portal to submit the work order.
3. Submit work orders with as much notice as possible, we get very busy with work orders
and they are likely to take five working days to complete (this may be longer depending on the
complexity and size of the job).
