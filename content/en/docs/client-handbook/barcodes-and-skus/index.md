It's essential that we correctly identify your products to allow us to store it correctly, 
track stock levels, and ultimately fulfil your customers orders accurately.

- All products need to have the correct barcodes and SKUs on your e-commerce platform.
- Additionally, the correct barcode labels must be visible and attached directly to the
products. Whilst booking in your ASN if we find that items have the incorrect barcodes we
will place the items into a holding bay until a Work Order is submitted giving instructions
to re-label the stock.
- In instances where your stock is very similar and new products are added to your range,
we would advise you to provide a full product listing that includes an image, SKU, and
barcode.
- All the same SKUs must be in the same carton.
- We require all garments to arrive in poly bags.
- All items must have commodity codes. Tu Pack won't check for commodity codes, nor
are we responsible for them being correct. Please ensure that you have thoroughly
checked the commodity codes as these are an essential element for shipping.
