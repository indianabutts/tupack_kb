All orders that are placed before 2pm will be picked, packed and despatched the same day. After 2pm, they will despatched the following working day.

## Picking

Once an order has been placed on your ecommerce platform, it will be pushed to our warehouse management system (WMS), typically within 15 minutes of the order being created.

If there are any issues with picking an order, such as insufficient stock, the Success Team will reach out to let you know and provide suggestions for how to move forward.

## Packing
If you meet our bespoke packing threshold, the onboarding team will discuss options on the most suitable packing procedure based on your products.

This will be finalised ahead of your **Go Live** date.
