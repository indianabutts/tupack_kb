We acknowledge that your business may sell on affiliate sites such as Bombinate, Collagerie and
others to assist in selling your products. We at Tu Pack want to ensure that we do not create an
extra hurdle for broadening your customer reach and therefore we have created a procedure to
ensure that we can fulfil your orders on third-party sites.

## The Procedure

- Find the company code for the third-party company
  - The company code for your third-party company will be 2-4 characters long. If you cannot find your third party companyâ€™s code, kindly contact our Success team.
  - Any order number that you input into our WMS involving that involves a third party must adhere to the following formatting:
  - Begin with the third-party company code (e.g. AA),
  - Immediately after the third-party company code, enter your company code (e.g. BB). This is usually the abbreviated number of your company. If you don't know this please reach out to the Success Team
  - Follow your company code immediately with your order number (e.g. 1234)
  - Using this example, the order number would be AABB1234
- The drop shippers label must be inputted into the manual order so that we can attach it to the parcel(s)
- The non-Tu Pack courier selection charge per order will be applied when dropshipping. This is to account for the handling of the order and the printing of the despatch label
- Any communication regarding the transit of the order must be directly through the couriers, as the order is not shipped under a Tu Pack courier account
