Following our Inbound Policy should enable us to book your inbound delivery into our WMS within 2 working days. This will mean that your stock can go live quicker and thus get to your customers faster. Failure to follow our procedures will significantly slow down our process as this will disrupt how we coordinate the movement of your stock.

## The Basics

1. Deliveries that include stock need to come in with an Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) on the system and a matching ASN number displayed on each of the cartons.
2. All deliveries must be addressed to the below and be delivered inside of our opening hours which are between 8 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday, exclusive of bank holidays.

The following should be used as your delivery note template:

```
Tu Pack
Care of [name of brand]
Unit 6 Kwikform Building
Hales Industrial Park
Coventry
CV6 6AT
[Reference: ASN number]

```
## ASN
Each ASN carton needs a packing list. 

If one of your carton(s) is missing from the ASN and fails to arrive within 24-hours 
of the arrival of the ASN, we will close the ASN and notify you right away. 

You are then required to create a new ASN for the missing cartons/items that did not arrive in the original delivery

ASNs need to be accurately populated into our WMS. This means that:

- All items in the cartons need to be included in the ASN.
- Once an ASN has been created on our WMS we would always advise to check for any
import errors, this may include SKUs clashing with existing SKUs or barcodes allocated
to existing products.
- ASN delivery dates on our WMS must match the date of arrival in the warehouse where
possible. If you are notified of any changes to the expected delivery date, please update
the ASN on our WMS no later than 48 hours before the expected delivery date.

ASNS must be on our WMS for a minimum of two working days prior to the delivery date.

## Barcodes and SKUs
{{< pagecontent "/docs/client-handbook/barcodes-and-skus" >}}


## Important Guidelines for Inbound Stock
- All inbound shipments need to be booked on our Warehouse Management System (WMS)
at least two days prior to the scheduled delivery date
- Each carton needs to display the ASN number and contain a packing list on the outside;
all products will require a barcode facing upwards;
if any additional work is required upon delivery, please notify us beforehand via our
Success Portal
- Should there be any changes to the expected delivery date, the ASN needs to be updated
accordingly
- Please provide us with the necessary product data for any new SKUs ahead of time, to
ensure swift processing
- Please ensure that there are no material discrepancies between the inbound shipment and
the ASN, e.g. incoming SKUs not listed on the ASN, significant short-shipment of expected
stock etc.

Charges in line with our Terms of Service will be applied if these guidelines are not
followed.

## Packaging Deliveries

Your packaging is booked onto our WMS and we require your packaging inbounds to be
logged via an ASN.

- All packaging deliveries must be identifiable and must contain a delivery note to ensure
that we can identify any discrepancies at hand. Therefore, all pallets/cartons must have
your identification (the company name) labelled on it.
- Any packaging that is not identifiable will be held in a holding bay.
- Any packaging that we cannot identify for longer than 8 weeks will be removed from Tu
Pack premises.

## Container Deliveries

Due to the size of containers and the limited time window (normally 3-hours) to unload
your stock, we have outlined below our requirements to unload, scan, and put away your
ASN as quickly as possible.

- The ASN must be booked into our WMS for a minimum of 10 days before its arrival. It
is essential that you are constantly updating the ASN on our WMS if there are any
changes to the delivery time.
- Please advise your supplier to arrange the container in SKU order, this means ensuring
that all SKUs are grouped together in the container.
- All SKUs must be in the same box.
- Styles must be in the same line in the container. This will enable us to implement a
snake loading process to unload the container, which will mean we can unload your
stock faster.
- Your ASN must have SKUs, barcodes, quantities and carton sizes which will allow us to
sufficiently prepare.
- We charge our labour rate to unload, scan and put away your ASN. This will be
processed via a Work Order on our Success Portal.
