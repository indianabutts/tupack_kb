### About Us
Tu Pack recognises the need to forge collaborative working partnerships with our brands, so that trading benefits may be realised by both parties. Working more closely and efficiently, we hope to help you achieve strong year-on-year sales growth.

### What's covered
This handbook sets out various requirements of how Tu
Pack operates. It provides guidelines for our fulfilment processes, sets out standards that Tu Pack expects its
partners to adhere to, details specific delivery compliance
issues that must be met and outlines the administrative
fees and liquidated damages charges that may be
applied for non-compliance. Adhering to our systems will
ensure that you can maximise your operational efficiency
and retail performance.
