Our Warehouse Management System (WMS) integrates with your choice of courier platform and your Ecommerce platform. When
we receive your items into our warehouse each product will be booked into a location within our
WMS. You will have access to our WMS, where you can follow the progress of all orders and
monitor despatches, pull inventory reports, input orders and see a detailed breakdown of your
invoices.

Our WMS is integral to our operations and we update it constantly in line with our activity.
Therefore, the WMS will have the master inventory (not your Ecommerce account).

From time to time, you will receive alerts from the WMS. It is important that you read these
alerts because they will often require a response from you.
