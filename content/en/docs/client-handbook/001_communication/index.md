Our Customer Success Team can assist you with all of your Tu Pack related queries, from a questions about an ASN to an update to your courier preferences. You can get in touch with them via our Success Portal, which you can find by [clicking here](https://support.tupack.co.uk/hc/en-gb)

## Best Practices

In order to minimise the chances of miscommunication or misunderstandings, there are some best practices that if followed will allow the relationship between yourself and Tu Pack to be extremely productive.



### Designating a Clear Point of Contact

Have a clear point-of-contact, with a maximum of two team members. 

This first allows for a very clear line of communication between us, limiting the risk of an erraneous request, or multiple open threads about the same issue being opened.

Second, this allows us to train your designated point-of-contact to become proficient in the systems we use, including our Support Center and the Warehouse Management System (WMS) that managed inventory, orders, picking and packing.

### Communicating through the Support Portal

We support our customers through our support portal, for us it allows us to very clearly understand what extra support you might need outside of the standard fulfilment flows. 

To that end, the more structured and rich the information in the request is, the more effectively we can plan, communicate to you, and ultimately action these requests.

To ensure that your requests are resolved as quickly as possible, submitting the request through the correct form will ensure that it reaches the correct team, and that they can get to work quickly, minimising the need for back-and-forth emails to get the context.

If you are unsure which form you need to submit we also have a guided-form that will help you find and submit the correct form.

Only requests submitted through the Success Portal are subject to the Communcation Service Level Agreement policy.

### Providing Context with your Request

When submitting the requests, please provide as much detail and information as possible so that we can resolve your query without delay. If the Success Team need to contact for further context, this may cause delays in resolving your query.

The rule of thumb is, **_there is no such thing as too much information_**.
