Please allow three working days for us to process returns.

Returned items that are identifiable and not damaged will be booked back into stock andreturned to the appropriate location with the rest of your inventory. This is the case even if the return falls outside of your returns window. If a returned item is not fit for resale, we will move it to the an unsellable location - please see below.

You will receive a notification for each return we process â€“ please ensure you enable this in your settings as it will be your responsibility to refund the customer and let them know of their refund/exchange being processed. You should refund your customer via your eCommerce or payment platform and notify your customer accordingly. 

## Unsellable Goods
Returned products not fit for resale will be moved to the damaged goods location, which
is an unpickable location. 

You will be notified via our WMS when an item has been moved to a damaged location. It is your responsibility to inform us what you will like us
to do with these items. Some reasons for a product to be deemed not fit for resale are stains, perfume odour, additional rework required (e.g. steaming) etc.
