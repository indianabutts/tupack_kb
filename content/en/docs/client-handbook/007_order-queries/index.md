The main queries the Success Team can assist you with are:

- Cancelling an order (restock and/or admin. charges may apply)
- Holding orders
  - £0.25 per parcel, per day
  - £0.63 per pallet, per day
- Splitting an order, for example where one item is out of stock:
  - The request to split an order must be received before 2 pm on the same day as the original
order is placed so that all available items can be despatched as soon as possible
  - Any items on back order will be despatched as soon as stock becomes available, either
from a return or an ASN
- Amending an address (if the request is placed prior to the picked stage)

The Success Team cannot action any of the following amendments:

- Adding new items
- Removing items from the order.
- Changing the size of any items.
- Changing the colour, style or SKU of the order contents

If your customer has requested any of these changes, you will need to follow the procedure outlined [here](../orders/amend-order/).

Please note that cancelling an order on your e-Commerce site will not cancel the order in our
WMS, therefore it is of the utmost importance that you raise a query with the Success Team to
have this actioned
