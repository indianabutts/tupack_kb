How a reconsigned parcel is handled can either be selected on a **case-by-case** cadence, or as a **default policy** for your account.

The two options for how a parcel is processed by us are:

1. The parcel is processed as a **standard return** in line with our returns policy, and will incur the standard associated costs of a returned parcel
2. The parcel will be **redespatched** to your customer and will incur a pick and pack charge as well as new shipping costs 

### Case-by-Case Approach

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
If you don't choose an option within 48 hours of the reconsignment, it will be processed as a standard return
{{% /alert %}}

Once your parcel has been received by the warehouse, you have 48 hours to notify us which of the two options above you would like to proceed with. If the 48 hour window expires before you inform us, the parcel will be processed as a **standard return** in-line with option 1 above.

### Setting a Default Policy

If you would rather have a default **reconsignment policy** with us, you can inform us via the success portal, or by submitting the form below

<div id="formkeep-embed" data-formkeep-url="https://formkeep.com/p/422597c6fce7abc94b0a046f99ecd86f?embedded=1"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://formkeep-production-herokuapp-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/formkeep-embed.js"></script>

<!-- Get notified when the form is submitted, add your own code below: -->
<script>
const formkeepEmbed = document.querySelector('#formkeep-embed')

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitting', _event => {
  console.log('Submitting form...')
})

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitted', _event => {
  console.log('Submitted form...')
})
</script>
