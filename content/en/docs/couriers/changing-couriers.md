## International Services

{{% alert title="What is DDU and DDP?" %}} 
**DDU (Delivered Duties Unpaid)** means that your customers are responsible for paying all relevant duties and taxes upon arrival of the package to the destination country. This process can cause delays with delivery.

**DDP (Delivered Duties Paid)** means that the custom and duties are handled before the package arrives at the destination country and is **highly recommended** for timely and hassle-free deliveries.
