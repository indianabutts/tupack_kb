We're so sorry that something isn't quite right with one of your deliveries.

There are typically two ways to claim against a delivery by the courier.

1. The item was lost in transit
2. The item was damaged in transit

## Claiming for Loss

If your customer has received a delivery notification but didn't receive anything from the courier, or they never recieved a delivery notification despite the delivery window elapsing, we can assist you in filing a **claim for loss** with the relevant courier.

To facilitate the process we'll require the following information:
1. Order Reference
2. Cost price of the product
3. Supporting cost price documentation
4. A statement from the customer stating they've checked with other residents in their property, with their neighbours, and any potential safe places the driver may have left the package.

<!-- Get notified when the form is submitted, add your own code below: -->
<script>
const formkeepEmbed = document.querySelector('#formkeep-embed')

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitting', _event => {
  console.log('Submitting form...')
})

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitted', _event => {
  console.log('Submitted form...')
})
</script>

## Claiming for Damage

If your customer received the package, but the items were damaged, we can assist you in filing a **claim for loss** with the relevant courier.

To facilitate the process we'll require the following information:

1. Order Reference
2. Cost price of the product
3. Supporting cost price documentation
4. A description and clear pictures of the damage to the product
5. Pictures of the internal and external packaging, highlighting any damage (if any)
6. A readable picture of the shipping labels
