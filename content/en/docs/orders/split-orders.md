Splitting an order can be used when some of your customers orders contain items on back order - you can send the in stock items from their order straight away and we'll despatch a second parcel when the stock comes in to fulfil the rest of the order. 


To split an order, please submit a request via the Success Portal or via the form below. On your request make sure to include the order number and the breakdown of items to be despatched now and those to be despatched later.

<!-- Get notified when the form is submitted, add your own code below: -->
<script>
const formkeepEmbed = document.querySelector('#formkeep-embed')

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitting', _event => {
  console.log('Submitting form...')
})

formkeepEmbed.addEventListener('formkeep-embed:submitted', _event => {
  console.log('Submitted form...')
})
</script>
