To submit a wholesale order you'll need to create a [manual order](manual-order) in [Mintsoft](https://mintsoft.co.uk). Please ensure you use the PO from the buyer to create this order to ensure there are no discrepancies.

The order number needs to reference your wholesale order to ensure the team can find and locate the correct packing instructions, PO and commercial invoice. Your order number should begin with WS and conclude with your PO number (WS-565656). Please ensure that you pass on the packing instructions as soon as you input the order. You can do this via the Success Portal, please submit a ticket in the ‘Orders’ category with the title ‘(order number) packing instructions’.
