We know your customers will be eager to receive their orders and might want to track them, to help you help your customers we have put together a quick guide that explains the tracking process for all of our couriers. 

_Happy tracking!_

To track a parcel, you will often need three pieces of information:

1. Courier service 
1. Tracking number 
1. Postcode

You can find all of this information using your Mintsoft orders, as you can see in the image below;
