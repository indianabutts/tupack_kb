{{% alert color="warning" title="Warning" %}}Amending or deleting an order in Shopify will not update Mintsoft and can cause issues with us fulfilling your order correctly. 

**Please follow the instructions on this page carefully**{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" %}} Orders cannot be amended after they have been invoiced {{% /alert %}}

Amending an order on Shopify can present problems with us fulfilling your orders as Shopify doesnâ€™t update Mintsoft to reflect the changes to the order. Instead, this will be referred to as an **Import Error**. Our warehouse team uses Mintsoft to pick, pack and ship all of your orders, therefore it is important that any changes are reflected in Mintsoft.

For minimal issues it's better to simply cancel the order in Mintsoft, and then create the amended order on Shopify again. That way we can ensure both Mintsoft and Shopify are in sync, and our Warehouse Staff can accurately action the request.

### Step 1 - Cancelling the Order in Mintsoft
