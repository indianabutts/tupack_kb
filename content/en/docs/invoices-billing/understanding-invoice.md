Every week you'll receive two invoices from us:
1. A condensed invoice via email, accessible through Xero
2. A more detailed invoice through your [Mintsoft Account](https://minstoft.co.uk)

## Understanding your Xero Invoice

The Xero invoice is the simpler of the two with less itemisation and detail.
The charges on your Xero invoice are as follows:

| **Item**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Picking Costs**      | The cost for Tu Pack picking and Packing your goods                                                                                                                       |
| **Postage**            | Courier charges. It is worth noting that Tu Pack doesn't have any control over these charges, they are costs imposed by the 3rd party couriers                            |
| **Packing Costs**      | The cost of our packaging, you will see this charge if you are on our popular Tu Pack packaging solution                                                                  |
| **Generic Admin Cost** | This is the admin cost from your pricing schedule. The admin charge is to cover your support from the Success Team, the Finance Team and general warehouse administration |
| **Returns**            | This is the cost for the processing of your returns                                                                                                                       |
| **Storage costs**      | Calculated from your stock levels throughout the week, these are updated and calculated on a Sunday                                                                       |
