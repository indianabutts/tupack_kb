Every week you'll receive two invoices from us:
1. A condensed invoice via email, accessible through Xero
2. A more detailed invoice through your [Mintsoft Account](https://minstoft.co.uk)

## Understanding your Xero Invoice

The Xero invoice is the simpler of the two with less itemisation and detail.
The charges on your Xero invoice are as follows:

| **Item**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Picking Costs**      | The cost for Tu Pack picking and Packing your goods                                                                                                                       |
| **Postage**            | Courier charges. It is worth noting that Tu Pack doesn't have any control over these charges, they are costs imposed by the 3rd party couriers                            |
| **Packing Costs**      | The cost of our packaging, you will see this charge if you are on our popular Tu Pack packaging solution                                                                  |
| **Generic Admin Cost** | This is the admin cost from your pricing schedule. The admin charge is to cover your support from the Success Team, the Finance Team and general warehouse administration |
| **Returns**            | This is the cost for the processing of your returns                                                                                                                       |
| **Storage costs**      | Calculated from your stock levels throughout the week, these are updated and calculated on a Sunday                                                                       |

## Understanding your Mintsoft Invoice

Your Mintsoft invoice will be much more detailed and itemised, so you can really scrutinise where your costs are coming from.

When you view your invoice on Mintsoft there will be a much more detailed breakdown of the costs to you. 

Firstly, there is a summary bar with some of your key figures for the week:

- Number of parcels sent that week
- Number of items sent out 
- Total picking cost, which is the total of both pick and pack charges 
- Shipping costs 
- Rework cost, this refers to your work orders for the week 
- Packaging costs; this is the cost for your use of Tu Pack packaging 
- Additional invoice items which relates to your admin fees
- Collection costs; this is your duties and tax charges if applicable
- Returns costs 
- Goods in costs
- Storage costs 
 

Below your summary bar you will see a more detailed breakdown of the costs, categorised by type and itemised by order. 

 

The additional invoice items category refers will display the costs related to -

- Work orders 
- Additional courier accounts and surcharges 
- Admin charges 
- Packaging charges 
- Any damaged goods storage charges
- Quarantine charges

There will then be a table which shows you the ‘Costs per Order, this includes the cost for picking and packing and shipping charges per order. 

The next section is ‘Invoiced Returns’ which shows you the cost per return. 

‘Invoiced Goods In’ displays the costs associated with the goods you have had delivered to the warehouse that week. This is all of your ASN’s and packaging inbounds. 

Invoiced storage is the charge for the storage of goods and packaging for the week. This includes individual units for e-commerce orders, palletised goods and your packaging supplies kept at the warehouse.
