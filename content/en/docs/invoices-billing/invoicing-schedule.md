## How often will I receive my invoice?
We issue our invoices weekly to ensure that you have as much visibility of our costs as possible. This helps us to maintain our commitment to transparency within our partnership. 

## When do I need to pay my invoice?
Tu Packâ€™s standard payment terms are 14 days, meaning all invoices will need to be settled within 14 days of them being sent.
