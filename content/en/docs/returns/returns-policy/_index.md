## Returning Items
{{< pagecontent "/docs/returns/returns-address">}}

Please allow **three working days** for us to process returns. 

You will receive a notification for each return we process â€“ please ensure you enable this in your settings as it will be your responsibility to refund the customer and let them know of their refund/exchange being processed. You should refund your customer via your e-commerce or payment platform and notify your customer accordingly.  

All returned items that are not damaged will be booked back into stock and returned to the appropriate location with the rest of your inventory. This is the case even if the return falls outside of your returns window, in which instance we would advise issuing the customer credit.
